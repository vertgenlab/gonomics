The human genome holds an extraordinary trove of information about human development,
physiology, medicine and evolution. Here we report the results of an international
collaboration to produce and make freely available a draft sequence of the human genome.
We also present an initial analysis of the data, describing some of the insights that
can be gleaned from the sequence.
