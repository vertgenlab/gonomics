// ThreeBit is a struct to represent long DNA sequences in a memory efficient format
// Seq holds the encoded DNA sequence.  The left-most three bits of Seq[0] hold the
// first base.  The first base is *not* encoded in the three least significant bits.
// Because 64 is not divisible by three, the right-most (least significant) bit
// is not used in the encoding scheme.  Len is the length of the DNA sequence, not
// the length of the Seq slice.

	Seq []uint64

// This could have been uint8, but with that I found lots
// of casting between uint64 and uint8.  I don't think many
// ThreeBitBases will be sitting around for a long time by themselves
// so I don't think the extra memory will be noticed.
// Even though it is encoded as 64 bits, only the last three can be used (zero to seven)
type ThreeBitBase uint64

// The four bases {A,C,G,T} and N are encoded with the numbers 0 to 4.
// If the length of the DNA sequence stored in the threeBit is not divisible by
// 21, then there will be "left over" space in Seq[len(Seq)-1].  Currently,
// if that "left over" space is filled with PaddingOne for one threeBit,
// and PaddingTwo for another threeBit, the threeBits can be quickly compared
// for perfect matches.  The padding is so that the bits in those bases will not match.
// TODO: the padding implementation is a bit messy and should probably be changed in
// the future.  This could be done by having the perfect match functions compare the
// number of matches they will return to the theoretical maximum based on the sequence
// lengths or padding our a mask could be applied in the comparison function.
