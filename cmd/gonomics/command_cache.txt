     [32mfaBin[0m                         [36mtakes a descending size ordered fasta and returns either a specified number of fastas that are either an entire fasta entry from the input or multiple records from the input (binNum option) or multiple fastas which have a minimum sequence size of specified length (minSize). The number of bins specified must be at most equal to the number of entries in the input fasta. These options cannot be combined.[0m

     [32mlastZWriter[0m                   [36mastZWriter was designed to write out lastZ pairwise inputs by contig where multiple references are being used. This function writes a text file where each line is an input for a lastZ pairwise alignment. It requires that each genome be broken with the 'byname' option of 'faSplit' in kentutils and named in the convention 'assemblyName.byChrom'. Within the parent directory of the byChrom directories, lastZWriter will build a directory tree for the outputs of lastZ. At the same level of the byChrom files it will create a set of directories with the naming convention reference.aligned within which will be directories for each contig of the reference genome. For each species being aligned to that reference lastZWriter will specify that lastZ should create an axt output file 'pairwiseDir/ref.species/referenceContig/aligningSpeciesByChromName.referenceByChromName.axt' that refers to the two fasta files used in the alignment. LastZWriter also requires a list of all species in the alignment, as well as a separate text file with a list of reference species. Matrices are hardcoded absolute paths by default in this version. In the default function matrices are assigned based on the distance between the reference and aligning species from each other as calculated by the PHAST all_dists function.However, the user has the option to specify a bool (option m) as false and provide a path in which they would like the needed matrices to be hardcoded. As an alternative to the all_dists function, or if there isn't an available tree of the necessary species, this function can also take a file to replace the specified allDists file. The first two columns of which would need to be every possible combination of your alignment (find an example in gonomics/lastZWriter/testdata directory). This function can be used directly within the terminal, but would be easiest to work with in a shell wrapper where inputs can be referred to in variables.[0m
